## Summary

This document introduces standard configurations for soulboundable NFTs. 

## Abstract

The goal of this arc is to introduce and standardize the concepts of "Soulbounded NFT" and "Soulboundable NFT".
A soulboundable NFT is an NFT, that can be soulbounded. The NFT can be soulbounded through what i call a "soulbinding transfer".
A soulbinding transfer is an application call to a smart contract, that atomically transfers the soulboundable NFT, freezes it,
and clears the freeze address, manager address, and clawback address. This ensures, that the NFT is permanently soulbounded to the 
receiving wallet.  

## Use Case
The concept of soulboundable tokens would make it configurable to soulbound tokens, when issuing a NFT transfer. 

Imagine a ticketing system, which uses ASA NFTs as a representation of a ticket. It would be possible for the ticket-issuer
to configure whether the ticket issued to an individual, should be tradeable or not tradeable. This would be as simple as 
doing a normal ASA transfer, if the ticket should be tradeable, or doing a soulbinding transfer, if the ticket should not
be tradeable. 


## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Soulbounded NFT
A "soulbounded NFT" is an ASA, which fulfills two conditions: 
1. The ASA is a pure NFT, per the definition provided in arc3.
2. The ASA is frozen, and has its manager address, freeze address, and clawback address set to empty.

### Soulbinding Contract
A soulbinding contract, is a smart contract, that can transfer a Soulboundable NFT into a
wallet, and then soulbound it. A call to this contract, has the following two things happen atomically, if the asset provided to the contract is a valid soulboundable NFTs:
1. The Soulboundable NFT is transfered from wallet A to wallet B (for two arbitrary wallets, A and B)
2. The Soulboundable NFT is frozen, and has its manager address, freeze address, and clawback address set to empty.
I will call this sequence of events "soulbinding transfer" throughout the arc. 

### Soulboundable NFT
A "soulboundable NFT" is an ASA, which fulfills these two conditions:
1. The ASA is a pure NFT, per the definition provided in arc3.
2. The ASA adheres to the ASA parameter conventions below.

### ASA Parameters Conventions

for this section, the address of the soulbinding contract, will be denoted as `souladdress` 

The ASA parameters of Soulboundable NFTs should follow the conventions for pure NFT tokens defined in [ARC-0003](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0003) except for the following parameters

* *Freeze Address* (`f`): 
    * **SHOULD** be set to `souladdress` 
* *Clawback Address* (`c`): 
    * **SHOULD** be set to `souladdress` 
* *Manager Address* (`f`): 
    * **SHOULD** be set to `souladdress` 
* *Reserve Address* (`c`): 
    * **SHOULD** be set to `souladdress` 


All of these parameters should be set on asset creation, 
so that the soulbinding contract can successfully do a soulbinding transfer with the asset.

## Rationale

For an ASA NFT to be described as soulboundable, it must meet the following criteria
1. Publicly verifiable
2. Non-fungible
3. Can be transfered in a soulbinding transfer.

The Algorand blockchain provides the instruments for publicly verifiable transactions.
The [ARC-0003](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0003)sets the conventions for creating non-fungible tokens. 
To satisfy the third requirement, the parameter conventions above should be followed, when the asset is created. 

For an ASA NFT to be described as soulbounded, it must meet the following criteria:
1. Publicly verifiable
2. Non-fungible
3. Non-transferable
4. Non-removeable

The same reasons for verifiability and non-fungibility applies as above. 
To make a NFT non-transferable and non-removable, thereby becoming soulbounded, the asset _Manager Address_,_Clawback Address_, and _Freeze Address_ must be set to empty, and the asset must be frozen.
